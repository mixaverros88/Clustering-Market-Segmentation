## Data preprocessing

Another observation from the graph concerns the domains of the two variables Age and Income. We understand that the domain for Age is from around 20 to 70, whereas for Income it is from around 40,000 to over 300,000. Which points to a vast difference between the range of these values. Therefore, we must incorporate an important step in our analysis, and we must first standardize our data. Standardization is an important part of data preprocessing, which is why weâ€™ve devoted the entire next paragraph precisely to this topic.

### New Columns

We create a new column called military. This column has 2 values 0 (no), 1(yes).
This column indicates if the person takes place at least in one war. 
In order to fill the War column we use the following columns
iFeb55,iKorean,iMay75880,iRvetserv,iSept80,iVietnam,iWWII

### Drop Colums

We drop the columns (iFeb55,iKorean,iMay75880,iRvetserv,iSept80,iVietnam,iWWII) that has information about in what war a person has involved since we add this information in military column.
